# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a computer vision system for a Raspberry Pi Zero W with Camera Module v2 to detect when cats are present on a kitchen counter. The system will use real-time image processing to identify cats and provide notifications when they are detected in the monitored area.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want to be notified when my cats are on the kitchen counter, so that I can prevent them from accessing food or potentially dangerous items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the camera detects a cat on the kitchen counter THEN the system SHALL trigger a notification within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a cat is detected THEN the system SHALL capture and save an image with timestamp
3. WHEN multiple cats are present THEN the system SHALL detect and count each individual cat
4. WHEN the detection confidence is below 70% THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger a false positive notification
5. WHEN a cat is on the black kitchen counter THEN the system SHALL distinguish it from cats on the light colored wood floor regardless of camera angle
6. WHEN either the lynx point cat (mostly white) or tabby cat (mostly brown) is present THEN the system SHALL detect both cat types accurately
7. WHEN all processing occurs THEN the system SHALL perform computation entirely on the Raspberry Pi device without external dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to run continuously without manual intervention, so that I can monitor my kitchen counter 24/7.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically begin monitoring the camera feed
2. WHEN the system encounters an error THEN it SHALL log the error and attempt to recover automatically
3. WHEN the Raspberry Pi reboots THEN the detection system SHALL start automatically
4. WHEN the system runs for 24 hours THEN it SHALL maintain stable performance without memory leaks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications through multiple channels, so that I can be alerted regardless of my location or device availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a cat is detected THEN the system SHALL send a push notification to my mobile device
2. WHEN a cat is detected THEN the system SHALL optionally send an email with the captured image
3. WHEN notifications fail to send THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
4. WHEN I'm away from home THEN I SHALL still receive notifications through internet connectivity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure detection sensitivity and monitoring schedules, so that I can customize the system to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the configuration interface THEN I SHALL be able to adjust detection confidence thresholds
2. WHEN I set monitoring hours THEN the system SHALL only detect cats during specified time periods
3. WHEN I enable/disable notifications THEN the system SHALL respect my notification preferences
4. WHEN I update configuration THEN the changes SHALL take effect without requiring a system restart

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detection history and captured images, so that I can review when and how often my cats access the counter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cats are detected over time THEN the system SHALL maintain a log of all detection events
2. WHEN I request detection history THEN I SHALL see timestamps, confidence scores, and associated images
3. WHEN storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up old images after 30 days
4. WHEN I access the web interface THEN I SHALL be able to view live camera feed and recent detections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to work reliably with the Raspberry Pi Zero W's limited resources, so that detection performance remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing camera frames THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 1 FPS for adequate detection performance
2. WHEN the system is idle THEN CPU usage SHALL remain below 50% to preserve system responsiveness
3. WHEN detecting cats THEN the system SHALL use optimized models suitable for ARM processors
4. WHEN memory usage exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection to prevent crashes
